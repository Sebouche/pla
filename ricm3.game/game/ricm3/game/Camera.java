/**
 * This class is to illustrate a simple animated character. It does not much,
 * but it shows how to load an animation sprite and how to cycle through the
 * entire animation.
 * 
 * Pay attention to the finite state automaton, that is, the entire behavior
 * behaves as an automaton that progress a step at a time. Look at the method
 * step(long).
 * 
 * About the behavior of the cowboy. The cowboy can rotate around, that is the
 * animation. But since using arms may be dangerous, his gun may explode.
